## About

`Adaptive Computation` (sometimes called `Dynamic Compute`) is the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its
`function` and `compute budget` for each example.

<!-- We can think of this as giving models a [System 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) mode. -->

Adaptive Computation techniques include **Mixture of Experts** (decoupling model
capacity and model compute) and **Early Exiting** (saving compute on easy
inputs) as well as sampling techniques.

<!-- [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) states that the two general methods to utilise large amounts of compute are `Learning` and `Search`. Whilst large pre-trained models focus on `learning` at _train time_, Adaptive Computation is about spending more compute at inference time with mechanisms similar to `Search`. -->

## Mixture of Experts (Sparse MoE)

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm uses a routing layer to choose a limited number of parameters
to apply to a given input rather than using all the available parameters.

This conditional computation allows us model capacity to increase without also
scaling the compute required for each forward pass. This is useful because
bigger models are more sample efficient and more compute efficient to train.

MoE models are also useful for compartmentalising knowledge and avoiding
negative interference from irrelevant computation.
[Mixtral-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) is an
open-weights MoE model which is comparable to much larger models. Google DeepMind similarly show that their [Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf) based on an MoE architecture is competitive with their much larger Gemini 1 Ultra. Databricks/Mosaic [DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm) is another powerful MoE model and it seems that MoE is now the go-to architecture for large models.

[JetMoE](https://research.myshell.ai/jetmoe), based on the [ModuleFormer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04640.pdf) MoE conception, shows that MoEs can also be effective at smaller scales.

**Skywork-MoE, Skywork (2024)**
[pdf](https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Skywork-MoE/blob/main/skywork-moe-tech-report.pdf)

> An open-source MoE in the style of Switch Transformer. They detail two training tricks for getting better MoE performance. Firstly they normalise the routing logits before it goes through the softmax in order to reduce the entropy in the router and make the router more decisive. Secondly they have a different auxiliary loss coefficient for each layer and this is tuned during training depending on how many tokens were dropped at that layer. This helps to reduce impact of the auxiliary loss as the router becomes more balanced and confident.

**DynMoE, CUHK: Guo et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14297)
[code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14297)

> One problem with the token choice MoE approach is that every token is allocated the same number of experts. Ideally for true adaptive computation this would be variable depending on how difficult the token is. The authors introduce a routing mechanism which allows for a variable number of experts per token as well as a procedure for dynamically changing the number of experts during training. This allows for better performance with less hyperparameter sweeping.

**DeepSeek-v2, DeepSeek (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04434)

> A large (236B), performant and open MoE with lots of details about training and checkpoints available. Useful for understanding a modern MoE recipe.

**MoEs for Deep-RL, Google DeepMind: Obando-Ceron et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08609.pdf)

> The authors show that MoEs can be used to improve the sample efficiency of popular RL systems such as DQN and Rainbow. The authors show that using MoEs (in particular the SoftMoE variant) improves the ultimate performance of the RL systems. Previously, scaling up the underlying models in RL systems was often wasteful in parameters, but the authors show using MoEs they can get predictable performance improvements with scale. This suggests that scaling laws for Deep RL systems could be possible.

**MoE Design Choices, EPFL: Fan et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13089.pdf)

> The authors ablate some decision decisions for MoEs and shows the benefits of compared to vanilla transformers. They unfortunately only study very small models and so similar analysis for larger models could likely be useful for the community.

ðŸŒŸ **Routers in Vision MoEs, DeepMind: Liu et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15969.pdf)

> Compares the performance of different routing mechanisms in MoEs trained on Vision tasks. They show that Language Model routers can adapt well to Vision and that for Vision tasks (where the task isn't autoregressive), Soft MoE outperforms. They also reframe some previous routing methods mathematically to more clearly detail the differences. Worth a read for anyone deciding which MoE approach to choose for their application.

**MoE-LLaVA, Peking University: Lin et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15947.pdf)
[code](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/MoE-LLaVA)

> Whilst MoEs have had much success in ViTs and LLMs, the authors also show that they can be effective in LVLMs (Large Vision Language Models). By exploiting the sparsity and increased parameter count of MoEs whilst maintaining FLOPs, we get the expected boost in both performance and hallucination avoidance.

[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01771.pdf)
[code](https://github.com/Zyphra/BlackMamba)
[models](https://huggingface.co/Zyphra)

> The authors combine the MoE paradigm with a recent SSM-based architecture
> Mamba. Mamba provides Transformer-like performance and scaling properties
> whilst using a sub-quadratic attention variant allowing for much larger
> sequence lengths. Here we see that this architecture can additionally be
> combined with MoEs to increase performance, similarly to MoEs for transformers
> or RNNs previously. For a general explainer on Mamba see [here](https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/2024/02/11/mamba.html).

ðŸŒŸ **Offloading for Fast MoE Inference, Moscow: Eliseev & Mazur (2023)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17238.pdf)
[official code](https://github.com/dvmazur/mixtral-offloading)

> Despite some open-weights MoEs being available, they are not the most popular
> models used for inference due to the large memory footprint required at
> inference time. To address this the authors propose architecture-aware
> quantisation, an LRU cache for experts (to exploit the fact that experts are
> more likely than chance to repeat for two adjacent tokens) and a speculative
> expert loading algorithm. Since the inputs (x) to each layer only differ
> iteratively by a small amount (due to the residual stream carrying information
> from layer to layer), they note that by applying the routing function for the
> subsequent layer at the current layer, you can get a good guess for which
> experts to load. The upshot of this is that MoE models, like Mixtral, can be
> run on consumer grade hardware with much increased generation speed. This is a
> huge win for inference efficiency in the memory constrained and single batch
> regime. [MoE-Infinity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14361.pdf) is a similar offloading paradigm with code [here](https://github.com/TorchMoE/MoE-Infinity)

[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16795.pdf)
[code](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/qmoe)

> Generally MoEs require larger footprints but fewer FLOPs compared to a dense
> model of which achieves similar performance. In the quest to reduce the memory
> footprint, we might seek to perform quantisation. The authors present a
> compression method which takes advantage of the inherent sparsity to compress

> compresses each fp16 weight to the equivalent of less than one bit. For the

**SparseMixer - Sparse Backpropagation for MoE Training, Microsoft: Liu et al
(2023)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00811.pdf)

> One of the most important parts of an MoE is the router which allows the
> experts to specialise well. Unfortunately, typical MoE training gives
> suboptimal routers as suggested by Hash routers performing almost as well as
> more principled routing mechanisms. This paper suggests the reason is due to
> MoE training ignoring parts of the gradient and suggests a midpoint-rule based
> gradient approximation which substantially improves training.

**MoV/MoLoRA, Cohere For AI: Zadouri et al (2023)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05444.pdf),
[official Jax code](https://github.com/for-ai/parameter-efficient-moe)

> Introduces parameter efficient MoE models where instead of routing between

> [HydraMoE](https://github.com/SkunkworksAI/hydra-moe) project also take a
> similar approach.

**Soft Merging of Experts (SMEAR), UNC: Zadouri et al (2023)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03745.pdf)

> Takes the opposite approach to Soft-MoE and averages the Expert weights rather
> than the tokens. This is interesting given that model merging approaches which
> show that linear combinations of models can perform well on tasks that either
> model was trained for. Note here the averaging operation can become
> prohibitively expensive if we different experts for each token (similar FLOPs
> to forward passes on all experts and ensembling). Hence the method relies on a
> Task-MoE approach of picking the same expert configuration on a per-example
> rather than a per-token basis.

**AutoMoE, UBC/Microsoft: Jawahar et al (2023)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07535.pdf),
[official PyTorch code](https://github.com/microsoft/AutoMoE)

> One of the promises of MoE is being able to apply different amounts of compute
> to each token. Generally, this has been achieved by different tokens being
> processed and dropped by different numbers of experts per layer. AutoMoE also
> uses differently sized experts to achieve more heterogeneity. They perform an
> Architectural search for optimal architectures given computational
> constraints.

ðŸŒŸ **Expert Choice MoEs, Google: Zhou et al (2022)**

> Introduces a principled, truly compute-adaptive MoE model. In traditional MoE
> models the tokens select the top experts that they would most like to be

<!-- There are possibly additional benefits to combining task and token level experts. We could input a task and use this to decide which routers that we want to use in our MoE layers see [Multi-gate](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3220007).
Alternatively we could concatenate task information to the input of the router network so it can use it if it wants.
It's not clear whether having inductive bias would be better.  -->

[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18928),
[repo](https://github.com/stylus-diffusion/stylus)

> Diffusion model users often use adapters rather than full finetunes to achieve models which perform well on a particular style. The authors here automatically select and compose relevant adapters for the prompt using a model routing approach. A nice application of inference-time routing which we might expect to become more commonplace in the future.

**MoDE - CLIP Data Experts via Clustering, Meta: Ma et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16030),
[pytorch code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP/tree/main/mode)

> The authors apply a Task-specific MoE based on training parallel CLIP models on restricted domains and ensembling these together. They show increased performance with less compute and note the ability to add in new "experts" for new domains asynchronously and after initial training as a Continual Learning play.

ðŸŒŸ **Mixture of Depths, DeepMind: Raposo et al (2023)**

## Early Exit: End-to-End Adaptive Computation

Early Exit approaches ask if we get the output of a neural network without going
through all the layers, particularly if faced with an easier example. This is
typically done by learning an exit probability at each layer.

**Sparse Universal Transformer (SUT), MILA: Tan et al (2023)**

> layer). They also use a new stick-breaking-based dynamic halting mechanism.
> This brings all the benefits of Sparse MoEs (such as less inference compute
> whilst having a lot of parameters) and the benefits of Universal Transformer
> (parameter efficiency, Turing-completeness and generalization ability)
> together.

> Extends the ACT method by giving the model a "tape" which contains some

> sequences.

**Dataset Pruning Using Early Exit Networks, GÃ¶rmez et al (2023)**
[pdf](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Kh114370zL)

> Early Exit Networks naturally learn which input examples are "easy" (can be

[PyTorch code](https://github.com/koayon/ml-replications/tree/main/ponder)

> Allows the model to exit after each transformer layer if it's confident in the

> [SkipNet](<[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09485)>) paradigm where we instead

## More Compute Per Output Token

**Masked Diffusion Language Models, Cornell: Sahoo et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07524),
[pytorch code](https://github.com/kuleshov-group/mdlm)
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjAUX23vgfg)

> Autoregressive models sample a single token at a time, regardless of how difficult this token is to predict. Diffusion models however have the benefit that the number of steps from the noised input to the final output can be varied which acts as a knob controlling the amount of compute applied. The authors introduce a simplified method for Diffusion Language models based on BERT which achieves better perplexity than previous Diffusion Language models (though not at autoregressive model levels). This avenue provides a different approach to varying compute per output token.

ðŸŒŸ **Quiet-STaR, Stanford: Zelikman et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09629.pdf),

> One of the core motivations of Adaptive Computation is noting that for

## Adaptive Computation for Black-box models

For black box pre-trained models, perhaps those behind an API, there are some
techniques for using Adaptive Computation. These are promising techniques for
those with limited compute budgets.

Prompting techniques such as

> The aim of the game is to repeatedly put the k tokens through the model until they reach a fixed point (i.e. a forward pass doesn't change them). (Also note that on this final forward pass we also have the k+1th token returned). This is an interesting approach that changes fundamentally the language modelling objective from autoregressive prediction to predicting trajectories for multi-token sequences.

## AI Safety

With adaptive computation, models can choose to use more compute on harder
problems.

For problems where we're concerned about systems failing by not being able to do
sufficient computation then Adaptive Computation is very positive for Alignment.
We should expect fewer mistakes from a model utilising Adaptive Computation,
even on more difficult problems. Additionally,
[Adaptive Computation based systems are less susceptible to Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.10253.pdf).
That is to say Adaptive Computation makes models more `robust`.

However, for problems where we're concerned about systems being deceptive or
mesa-optimising increasing the amount of inference-time compute increases their
ability to do so. Here the failure is not a "mistake" but entirely intentional
from the system's perspective. Inference-time search is one way that a model
could implement [deceptive alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01820.pdf) for
example.

## Scaling Laws


**Toward Inference-Optimal MoEs, UCSD: Yun et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02852)

> The Chinchilla scaling laws focused on how to allocate compute to get the best model for a given amount of training compute. Since then LLama and others have focused on optimising for inference-compute as well as training compute. For MoEs there are additional considerations here - how many experts should you assign for the parameter count given that at inference time cost depends on the active parameters? The authors find that fewer experts are more efficient at inference time but more experts are more efficient at training time.

**Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws, Meta: Allen-Zhu & Li (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05405.pdf)

> The authors examine the Physics of Language Models and how much
> data they can store per parameter. They find that typically models can store
> around 2 bits per parameter, and this doesn't reduce too much with MoE models.
> This confirms (since MoEs are typically much larger in parameter count) that
> these models can store a lot more information than traditional models.
> It also suggests that knowledge capacity is relatively independent of
> forward pass compute giving a natural (if imprecise) cleaving of intelligence
> represented in compute applied and knowledge represented in the parameters.

## Other

**Blending Is All You Need, Cambridge: Lu et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02994)

> Mark this under "bizarre". They have a multi-modal setup where they completely randomly and uniformly select a model to answer each query in a conversation. The authors report higher user engagement and retention metrics using this approach over each individual model. One hypothesis is that each model can influence models that answer afterwards through the conditioning on previous tokens and there might be some implicit benefits to a model seeing tokens which are slightly off-distribution for what it would have produced. Perhaps they also have different refusal policies too. It's not clear why this should work but this provides a floor for more sophisticated model routing procedures.

**Buffer Overflow in MoEs, DeepMind: Hayes et al (2024)**
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05526.pdf)

> Typically with token choice routing methods in MoEs, there are implicitly cross-batch dependencies (i.e. the same token could be routed to different experts if in it's batch most of the other tokens also wanted to go to its preferred expert). The authors show that this batch dependency can be used as an attack surface. They present a few solutions - mostly this shouldn't be a problem if batch sizes are very large (as in inference in a big AI lab) but it's an interesting one to watch out for. We might expect ML systems security to be an increasingly large field of research.

<!-- ## Approaches We're Excited To See Explored More

- When we have early exiting we essentially have to train classifiers for each layer in addition to the main model so we have additional overhead for training which is going to save us compute at inference tine. Are there better, more principled ways of early exiting at train time as well so that we don't have to learn very much from easy tokens?

- Current approaches to sparsity are mainly transformer with some sparsity added on the margin. Transformers have worked so well and people are generally leaving them alone and messing with everything else around them - we're interested in paradigm shift approaches which are completely sparse and move further away from the transformer.
